# Memory Game Project

This is my "Memory Game" project at Front-End Nanodegree Program.


## Playing instructions:

In this game you can match pairs of cards.
* Click to open pair of cards, when you start the game. If they are the same, then you have to find another two cards to match, until finding all cards pairs.
* When you open all the cards pairs, you will be congratulate by winning message.
* You will see the score, moves and time it took to complete the game by winning message.
* At this message, you can click on the repeat button, if you want to play again.


## Game Installation

1. Clone my repo to install the game: https://github.com/Merkanto/fend-project-memory-game.
2. After that, open index.html in your favourite browser and play the "Memory Game".
